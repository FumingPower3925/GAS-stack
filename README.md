# GAS: Security meets highly performant simplicity

Leveraging the simplicity of Alpine JS CSP, with the performance of golang.

Using gomponents, the capacity of scalability of any project build with this stack is guaranted.

To run it:

```
go run main.go
```

And then go to: `localhost:8080`

# Secure?

This is the base of a highly secure web stack. 

**Why?**

- [X] It lets you build almost anything **without additional dependencies**, just gomponents and Alpine JS csp, that's it
- [X] It can work with the **strictest CSP policies**
- [X] If correctly build, all **javascript will have SRI**
- [X] **Server-Side Logic by Default**
